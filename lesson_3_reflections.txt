When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I am working in collaboration with other developers on a project, I will have to use remote repository. Also to store and share my code with other developers and allow them to contribute or if I am working on different systems I will use remote repository.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There could be numerous commits on a branch and if Git automatically pulls all commits I might show broken files or incomplete project to others on git. Hence it makes sense to push a branch when a developer has finished or satisfied with the assigned task.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is a GitHub feature used to copy someones repository into our git hub account. Clones are used to copy a repository from git hub to our local computer or copy a repo from one location to another on our local system.
Branches are used when multiple developers are working on a same project but on different features or if a developer is working on a feature without disturbing a master branch.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

When working in collaboration with other developers, knowing the last known state of the remote will help compare changes made by other developers and merge it into our modifications by resolving conflicts (if any).
